This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error. The program uses a recursive function that calls itself with a decreasing argument until it reaches a base case. If the initial argument is too large, the function will cause a stack overflow, resulting in a program crash. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this problem using an iterative approach.
